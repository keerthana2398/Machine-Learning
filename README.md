# Machine-Learning
1. Advanced Feature Engineering
Target Encoding: Encoding categorical variables based on their impact on the target variable.
Feature Interaction: Creating polynomial or interaction terms between important features.
Automated Feature Selection: Using SHAP, LASSO, Boruta, or FeatureTools for automated feature selection.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like PCA, ICA, or Autoencoders to extract meaningful representations.
2. Hyperparameter Optimization
Bayesian Optimization (Optuna or Hyperopt) – More efficient than grid/random search.
Genetic Algorithms for Hyperparameter Tuning – Using evolutionary techniques.
Population-Based Training (PBT) – Dynamically adjusting hyperparameters while training.
3. Ensemble Learning & Stacking
Stacking Models: Combining multiple models using meta-learners.
Blending: Weighted averaging or learning-based combinations of models.
Voting Ensembles: Using hard/soft voting with RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.
4. Model Interpretability & Explainability
SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for feature impact visualization.
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) for explaining individual predictions.
Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to understand non-linear dependencies.
5. AutoML
H2O AutoML
Auto-Sklearn
TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool) for automated model selection.
6. Model Deployment & CI/CD
Deploying ML Models using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit / Gradio
Automating Deployment with Docker + Kubernetes
Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for ML Pipelines
Model Versioning with DVC (Data Version Control)
7. Handling Imbalanced Data
SMOTE, ADASYN for Synthetic Data Augmentation
Cost-sensitive Learning (Class Weights, Focal Loss)
Anomaly Detection Methods like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM
8. Advanced Time Series Forecasting
Facebook Prophet, GluonTS, Neural Prophet
Multi-step & Multi-variate Forecasting
LSTMs and Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN)
9. Self-Supervised & Semi-Supervised Learning
Contrastive Learning (SimCLR, MoCo)
Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Learning
Autoencoders for Unsupervised Feature Extraction
10. Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
Using NASNet, AutoKeras, or PyTorch Lightning for automatic architecture search.
